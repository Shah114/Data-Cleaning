# Data-Cleaning
<br/>
Data cleaning is one of the important parts of machine learning. It plays a significant part in building a model.<br/>
<br/>
**What is Data Cleaning**<br/>
Data cleaning is a crucial step in the machine learning (ML) pipeline, as it involves identifying and removing any **missing, duplicate, or irrelevant data**. The goal of data cleaning is to ensure that the data is accurate, consistent, and free of errors, as incorrect or inconsistent data can negatively impact the performance of the ML model. Professional data scientists usually invest a very large portion of their time in this step because of the belief that **“Better data beats fancier algorithms”**.<br/>
<br/>

**Usage**<br/>
Follow these steps to clean your data:<br/>
1. Load Data: Load your raw data using the load_data.py script.
2. Clean Data: Use the clean_data.py script to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct errors.
3. Transform Data: Apply necessary transformations using the transform_data.py script.
4. Save Data: Save the cleaned data using the save_data.py script.<br/>
<br/>

**Features**<br/>
1. Missing Values Handling: Impute or remove missing values.
2. Duplicate Removal: Detect and remove duplicate entries.
3. Error Correction: Identify and correct errors in data entries.
4. Data Transformation: Apply transformations such as scaling, encoding, etc.
